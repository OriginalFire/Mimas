# Mimas - Build Log

My journey into the dactyl world.

After using the GMMK since it was first launched I was itching to build a new keyboard. I knew I didn't want the traditional layout of staggered
keys, but something more ergonomic like column staggered so I started looking into split keyboards. As I was on the hunt for a split keyboard, I came to the 
realization that there was not a split keyboard with the layout I was looking for so I built my own from scratch. I instantly fell in love with it, but there was 
one tiny issue, I had difficulty reaching the number row and the 'Q' and the 'P' key due to my short fingers. So much so that I dreaded doing a monkey type test
where there were a lot of words with the letter 'P'.

Thus I decided to build another split keyboard 8 months later.

## Layout

My first split had a layout similar to the the Fold by Keebio

Mostly because I still wanted to use standard modifier keycaps that come with most keycap kits.

Eventually I settled on this layout:

Added a thumb cluster for Ctrl, Alt, Win, Layers and repositioned the columns to better match my fingers

Luckly I can still put GMK (or similar keycap sets) keycaps with this layout as long as there is a 40s kit available
